    <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">What is Global Warming ❓</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 23px;">Global warming is the gradual increase in temperature near the Earth's surface. This
        behavior has been seen for the last one or two centuries. This alteration has altered the earth's climatic
        pattern. However, the concept of global warming is extremely controversial, yet scientists have presented
        important data to support the fact that the Earth's temperature is constantly rising.

        Global warming is caused by a variety of factors that are harmful to humans, plants, and animals. These factors
        could be natural or the result of human efforts. Understanding the harmful effects of global warming is critical
        for addressing the challenges.</p>



    <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Causes of Global Warming 😑</h2>

    <h3  style="font-size: 25px;" >Following are the major causes of global warming:</h3>
    <h3 style="font-size: 25px;">Man-Made Causes of Global Warming</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 23px;">

        <strong>Deforestation:🌲 </strong>
        <br>

        Plants are essential for providing oxygen. They absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, keeping the
        environment balanced. However, forests are being cut down for various purposes, leading to an imbalance and
        contributing to global warming.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Use of Vehicles: 🚙</strong>
        <br>
        Driving vehicles, even for short trips, releases gases into the air. Vehicles burn fossil fuels, which produce a
        lot of carbon dioxide and other pollutants, increasing the Earth's temperature.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong> Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs):  </strong>
        <br>
        Using air conditioners and refrigerators releases CFCs into the air. These chemicals harm the ozone layer, which
        protects us from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. Damage to the ozone layer allows more UV rays to reach the
        Earth, raising its temperature.
        <br>
        <br>
    </p>

    <h3 style="font-size: 30px;">Natural Causes of Global Warming</h3>

    <p style="font-size: 23px;">
        <strong>Volcanoes:🌋</strong>
        <br>

        Volcanoes are a major natural cause of global warming. When they erupt, the ash and smoke released into the
        atmosphere can affect the climate.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Water Vapor: </strong>
        <br>
        Water vapor is a greenhouse gas. As the Earth's temperature rises, more water evaporates from oceans and lakes,
        staying in the atmosphere and adding to global warming.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Melting Permafrost:</strong>
        <br>
        Permafrost is frozen soil that traps gases. Found under the Earth's surface, especially in glaciers, it releases
        these gases when it melts, which increases the Earth's temperature.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Forest Fires: 🔥</strong>
        <br>
        Forest fires release a lot of carbon-rich smoke into the air. These gases contribute to global warming by
        raising the Earth's temperature.
        <br>
        <br>
    </p>


    <h3 style="font-size: 30px;">Effects of Global Warming</h3>

    <p style="font-size: 23px;">

        <strong>Rise in Temperature: 🌡️</strong>
        <br>
        Global warming has caused a significant increase in Earth's temperature. Since 1880, the temperature has risen
        by about 1 degree Celsius. This warming has accelerated glacier melting, which raises sea levels and threatens
        coastal areas.
        <br>
        <br>

        <strong>Threats to the Ecosystem:</strong>
        <br>
        Global warming negatively impacts coral reefs, leading to the loss of plant and animal life. The rising global
        temperatures have made these delicate ecosystems even more vulnerable.
        <br>
        <br>

        <strong>Climate Change:</strong>
        <br>
        Global warming has altered weather patterns, causing droughts in some areas and floods in others. This imbalance
        in climate conditions is a direct result of global warming.
        <br>
        <br>

        <strong>Spread of Diseases: 🤒</strong>
        <br>
        Global warming changes heat and humidity patterns, which helps mosquitoes and other disease-carrying insects to
        spread to new areas, increasing the risk of illnesses.
        <br>
